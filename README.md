# CS 120 Final Project
Code By Harrison Thompson 

This program creates a fully functioning maze game in which the goal is to move the 
character through the maze without touching the walls all the way to the purple
square to win!

## Setup
Lucky for you nothing extra needs to be done to set this up. Just press run and go!

# Running the Program
When first running the program you will that starts with a menu screen 
that has instructions and the red play button. When the play button is pressed 
the maze is displayed along with the goal (the purple square) and the red character square.
The arrow keys must then be used to manveuver the red square around the maze without touching 
any of the walls or you will lose and be brought to the ending screen. If you are able to pass
through the maze and reach the purple square the winning screen will pop up congratulating 
you with a button to press as well. When the button is pressed each time more congratulation
confetti will pop up. The program must be re-run to try again.
